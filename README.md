# Web Development Practice

This repository contains projects and exercises developed as part of my learning journey in full-stack web development. It is a personal resource for honing skills in front-end and back-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, React, PostgreSQL, and more. The projects are designed to solidify understanding of modern web development tools and practices, while building a comprehensive portfolio to demonstrate proficiency. Additionally, test cases and exercises are included to ensure the correctness and performance of each implementation.
